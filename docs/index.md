# Welcome to Dicentis' User Guide

I'm glad you found your way to this documentation. Up to now, there is not much here to find. But as soon as the plugin reaches a stable version many (hopefully) useful tutorials and how-tos are presented here. So bookmark this page for later reference and you are ready to go.

As long as the plugin is in beta status writing documentation is not my first priority for 2 reasons:

- (1) Things are not ready to document and may change in the future and
- (2) it is more important to get a stable version finish. But if a feature is already stable and finish maybe I will start documenting it here.

So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish!
